<h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
<p>The game I created with my group members is played digitally and physically. The game board of the match in inspired by 
  Monopoly and digital games were inspired by Mario (mini-games). You start the game by rolling a die (custom-made) if you roll
  a 4 you can start the game (you get three tries to roll the dice until you get a 4 but that's only at the beginning of the game)
  three-game pieces are going to be used to move around the board game A robot, a Black horse, and a Titanic. 
  As you move around the board game using the custom-made dice there are three mini-games where you have to get to a specific score to 
  get an advantage. The whole point of the game is to be the first to get to the end! </p>
