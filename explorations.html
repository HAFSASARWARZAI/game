<h1>ABOUT THE GAME</h1>
<p> The game I created with my group members is played both digitally and physically. The game board of the game in inspired by 
  monopoly and the digital games were inspired from Mario (mini-games). You start the game by rolling a dice (costume made) if you roll
  a 4 you can start the game (you get three tries to roll the dice untill you get a 4 but thats only at the begining of the game)
  there are three game pieces that are going to be used to move around the board game A robot, Black horse, and a titanic. 
  As you move around the board game using the costome made dice there are three mini game where you have to get to a specific score to 
  get an advantage. The whole point of the gaame is to be the first one to get to the end! </p>
